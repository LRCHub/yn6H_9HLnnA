So tell me when did it start falling apart?
Everything that I know
Hitting me hard, caught me off guard
Where did all the time go?
Days are getting colder
When I think of getting older
I go back to when I had no doubts
Thought these times would last forever
Took a good look in the mirror
Better get my shit together now
Wish that I could slow this down
I gotta face it now
Wish you were still around
So tell me when did it start falling apart?
Everything that I know
Hitting me hard, caught me off guard
Where did all the time go?
I can feel those easy days slip away as
Memories fade, nothing's the same
Guess I better act my age
Filled with innocence
But lately nothing's making sense
I try to get it right but don't know how
Took it all for granted
Guess I didn't understand it
They say that youth is wasted on the young
So tell me when did it start falling apart?
Everything that I know
Hitting me hard, caught me off guard
Where did all the time go?
I can feel those easy days slip away as
Memories fade, nothing's the same
Guess I better act my age
I miss the days when we were younger
'Cause now I feel like I'm going under
Somehow time slipped through our fingers
Yeah, I miss the days, miss the days
When we were younger
(Yeah, I miss the days, miss the day)
So tell me when did it start falling apart?
Everything that I know
Hitting me hard, caught me off guard
Where did all the time go?
I can feel those easy days slip away as
Memories fade, nothing's the same
Guess I better act my age
