(One, two, three, four)
When I'm fat and old
and my kids think I'm a joke
'Cause I move a little slow
when I dance
I can count on you after all
that we've been through
'Cause I know
that you'll always understand
I won't act my age,
no I won't act my age
No, I'll still feel the same
around you
Hey!
(Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na...)
When I'm fat and old
and my kids think I'm a joke
'Cause the stories that I told,
I tell again and again
I can count on you
after all we got up to
'Cause I know that you truly
understand
I won't act my age,
no I won't act my age
No, I'll still feel the same
around you
I won't act my age,
no I won't act my age
No, I'll still feel the same
and you will too
Hey!
(Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na...)
When I can hardly walk and
my hair is falling out
We'll still stay up till morning
We'll throw the after party
Oh yeah, oh yeah
I won't act my age,
no I won't act my age
No, I'll still feel the same
around you
I won't act my age,
no I won't act my age
No, I'll still feel the same
and you will too
Hey!
Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na...
